comics
------

A small script to download web comics to read offline.


This project wouldn't exist without the amazing work of:
-  @audreyr for the cookie cutter project(https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) that large parts of the packaging scripts were taken from.
- The amazing people at PSF for making AsyncIO
- The amazing people who made aiohttp; whose library is heavily used through this project.
